i have no idea how design doc is gonna work, but here we go

so the idea is to have a qt window for the user to interact with to provide files and whatnot.
ideally it'd also have support for cli switches of you prefer a terminal, and the visualization would be in a seperate window, similar to qemu
i dont know how i'd go about doing that yet, but sys is used for switch support in the event i do later on.

resource for a plain window is here: https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/creating-your-first-pyqt-window/
